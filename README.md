Application name: RecNN

Reasoning: Portmanteau of Recommendation + Nearest Neighbours and a play on reckoning. Since we're calculating or estimating recommendations for a particular song, we feel this is perfect.

Most of the work has been done without constantly uploading to GitHub. We will correct this for future portions of the project.
